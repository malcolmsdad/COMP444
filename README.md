"# COMP444" 

Based on the instructions I understand we have a certain freedom to our blog. I've decided to structure based off of OneNote notebooks - I absolutely love OneNote and live by it professionally.  

Each unit will be a "Section", then sections will be broken into pages for introductions/descriptions of the unit, as well as a personal summary of readings, and SIK exercises.  

For each unit submission, I will do an extract of that unit to HTML or PDF.  

Final project submission will be a complete export of the notebook. 
I will include images/videos examples of exercises within the pages when possible, however they are also available via my git repo: https://github.com/malcolmsdad/COMP444/tree/main  
(FYI Malcolm is the name of one of my adorable dumb cats)

Each Unit submission will also include an update to my OneNote course notebook available on my git here:
