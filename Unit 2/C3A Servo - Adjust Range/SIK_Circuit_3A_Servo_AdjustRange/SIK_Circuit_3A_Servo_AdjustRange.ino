  Circuit 3A-Servo

  Move a servo attached to pin 9 so that it's angle matches a potentiometer attached to A0.

#include <Servo.h>          //include the servo library

int potPosition;           //this variable will store the position of the potentiometer
int servoPosition;         //the servo will move to this position

int minServoPosition = 100; // the minimum degree position the servo can move to. Default was 20.  The higher the number, the smaller the range
int maxServoPosition = 110; // the maximuim degree position the servo can move to. Default was 160.  The lower the number, the smaller the range. 
                            // The program will santize these values and no permit under rotation, over rotation, over invalid input, ie: min > max.

Servo myservo;              //create a servo object

void setup() {

  myservo.attach(9);        //tell the servo object that its servo is plugged into pin 9

}

void loop() {



  potPosition = analogRead(A0);                     //use analog read to measure the position of the potentiometer (0-1023)

  // clean inputs variables
  int minP = min(minServoPosition, maxServoPosition); // ensure we get the lower value of the two.. dont want no tricksters here
  int maxP = max(minServoPosition, maxServoPosition); // ensure we get the higher value...

  // protect the device
  minP = max(20, minP);  // do not let values below 20 
  maxP = min(160, maxP);  // do not let values above 160

  servoPosition = map(potPosition, 0, 1023, minP, maxP); //convert the potentiometer number to a servo position from 20-160
                                                      //Note: its best to avoid driving the little SIK servos all the
                                                      //way to 0 or 180 degrees it can cause the motor to jitter, which is bad for the servo.

  myservo.write(servoPosition);                      //move the servo to the 10 degree position
